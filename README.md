# F.A.W.S. 
Decentralized serverless for the masses. 

## Getting started 
### Node operators/Non-technical
Please refer to the [execution client](../execution-client/README.md) for instructions on how to run a node using our one line installer.

### Consumers/Technical
Please refer to the [contract readme](./contract/README.md) for details about F.A.W.S., including guidelines for setting up packages for execution on the F.A.W.S. network.

### Developers
Please refer to the following directories/readmes for more information:
* [contract](../contract/README.md): The backend for F.A.W.S, built on NEAR
* [execution client](../execution-client/README.md): The component that runs off chain workloads
* [playbook](../playbook/README.md): The one line installer for the execution client
* [frontend]

## Vision
F.A.W.S. is a platform for decentralized serverless that allows anyone to run arbitrary code on any device. It is built on top of NEAR Protocol, a sharded, proof of stake blockchain, and was created by amit4h and ad0ll for MetaBuild III.

We created F.A.W.S. due to our concerns over the industry's tendency to incorporate some or significant centralization in web3 products, often by running off chain workloads on exclusive networks and by using centralized cloud providers for deployments. 

We think that mobilizing the public is one of the best ways to combat this trend. There are billions of computers out in the wild that could be used to run web3 workloads, but there are few products that are accessible to the billions of people who own them.  With F.A.W.S., we aim to empower providers to easily offer up their computing power to the chain by reducing and eliminating financial and technical barriers to entry. We then entice them to stay by providing rewards whenever their computing power is used.

On the other side, we understand that developers rely on cloud providers for their off chain workloads because they are easy to use, cheap, reliable, and can be configured for specific jobs. We aim to provide a similar experience with F.A.W.S. from two angles. First, our focus on accessibility makes it easy for users to add compute to the network, leading to a larger, expansively decentralized backend that has many of the same guarantees of redundancy and reliability promised by cloud providers. Second, by empowering developers to run arbitrary code on the F.A.W.S. network using tools that they are already familiar with.
